            <NewsCard title="The key benefits with a meeting room booking system" article="Our customers provide us with valuable insight about which problems they experience at their workplaces. In this article I will list 4 common headaches when it comes to meeting room utilization and furthermore, how a room booking software can solve these issues: 1. Interruptions in work and during meetings
Open-plan and hot-desking offices are immensely popular and the trend doesn't seem to decline. But, having these kinds of work spaces also demands access to alternative room resources, like smaller group or meeting rooms. Employees in open-plan offices are easily disturbed with a lot of interruptions. Therefore it's really important that there are separate rooms accessible where employees could actually close the door and really concentrate for a while. This also passes for meetings - is there anything more annoying than the knock knock on the door followed by the question 'When is this room available?'? Well yeah there probably is... But hey you get the point!

So, how can a meeting room booking system let you work undisturbed?

Customers often tell us that one of their crucial buying criteria is that the room booking displays have to be simple to understand, for everyone. I would dare to say that Meetio Room is probably the simplest room signage on the market. It is based upon the classic traffic light system which, I hope, everyone is familiar with. The tablets are mounted outside the rooms and clearly show for how long a room is available or occupied."

        <NewsCard title="What is Christmas Jumper Day about and how long has it been going on?" article="Christmas Jumper Day is back again this year to help raise money for Save The Children, a charity which helps youngsters all over the world. Although the idea of wearing festive jumpers around Christmas time is nothing new, Save the Children launched their official Christmas Jumper Day seven years ago in 2012 as a way to raise money for projects they fund which help children around the world build a better future. To take part, people simply have to wear a festive jumper (the sillier, the better) to school or to work or if your organisation is participating in the charity day and donate £2 to Save The Children to do so."

            <NewsCard title="Room Color and How it Affects Your Mood" article="The colors of the rooms in your home are a direct reflection of your personality. While most of us may not spend a lot of time thinking about room color, it affects us every day. Room color can influence our moods and our thoughts.
            Keep in mind that each color has a psychological value. Think about how certain colors make you feel; they can influence any emotion, from tranquility to rage. To create peace and harmony in your home, choose your colors wisely; some colors in large amounts might have the opposite effect on you and your loved ones. Colors act in three basic ways: active, passive and neutral. You can easily match every room’s colors to your personal desires, to your taste and to the room’s purpose. Light colors are expansive and airy, making rooms seem larger and brighter. Dark colors are sophisticated and warm; they give large rooms a more intimate appearance." link="https://freshome.com/room-color-and-how-it-affects-your-mood/"
